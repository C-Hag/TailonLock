/* glb.h - our own reader for glTF 2.0 binary files (.glb). Original code,
 * written from the Khronos glTF 2.0 specification (the GLB file format, and
 * the buffers, buffer views, accessors, meshes, materials, nodes and scenes
 * it describes); no other glTF implementation was looked at.
 *
 * Brick 5, the container: a GLB file is a 12-byte header (magic "glTF",
 * version 2, total length) and then chunks, each a length, a type and that
 * many bytes, starting and ending on 4-byte boundaries. The first chunk is
 * the JSON document; a BIN chunk, if any, comes second and holds buffer 0.
 * Chunks of other types are skipped. Every length is checked against the
 * bytes actually there, so a short or lying file is refused, never read past.
 *
 * Brick 6, buffer views and accessors: buffer 0 is the BIN chunk (buffers
 * with a uri are not read). A buffer view is a byte range of a buffer, with
 * an optional stride; an accessor is a typed array in a view: count elements
 * of SCALAR, VEC2-4 or MAT2-4, each component a signed or unsigned 8-, 16- or
 * 32-bit integer or a 32-bit float, read little-endian. Offsets must be
 * aligned to the component size, matrix columns start on 4-byte boundaries,
 * and the last element must end inside its view, which must end inside its
 * buffer. Sparse accessors and accessors without a view are refused.
 *
 * Brick 7, meshes, materials and nodes, into our mesh format (core/mesh.h):
 * the scene's node tree is walked with each node's matrix or translation,
 * rotation and scale; every triangle primitive (list, strip or fan) of every
 * mesh is added, with the colour of its material. Our own writer stores a
 * mesh so that it reads back exactly: the vertices once, as 32-bit floats;
 * the faces in their order, one primitive for each run of faces of one
 * colour, as triangle fans; and, in the primitives' and materials' extras
 * (the format's place for an application's own data), each face's corner
 * count, the exact colour and the mesh's radius. Other glTF readers see
 * ordinary coloured triangles. */
