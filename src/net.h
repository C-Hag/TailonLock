/* net.h - network play over UDP, on a LAN or across the internet (JS NET,
 * netPublish, netIngest, netApplyRemote). As in the browser game, each
 * computer flies its own jets and sends their state about 30 times a
 * second; the other computer eases its copies toward it. Hits are decided
 * on the computer that owns the jet or target that is hit; missiles,
 * decoys and blasts travel as events. The host runs the CPU jets and picks
 * the map and the rules.
 *
 * Three ways to meet: on a LAN the host is found by a broadcast beacon; over
 * the internet the guest types the host's address (UDP NET_PORT forwarded
 * on the host's router), or both go through a relay server (relay/) with a
 * game code and need no port forwarding.
 *
 * Every way needs the host's 6-digit game code: it becomes a secret key the
 * two computers share, and the match travels encrypted under it (net.c). */
