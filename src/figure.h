/* figure.h - the figure engine: people as low-poly 3D meshes made in code. A skeleton is sized by Leonardo's canon

 * their bones; uniforms and kit are colours and small parts made the same way. The same engine as the browser game's
 * (assets/figure/figure.js); both make the same triangles. Original code for this project. Units: metres, y up,
