/* room.h - the control room in 3D, made in code like the people (figure.h): the combat centre of the opening film,
 * the way the big gun ships had theirs after their 1980s refits, here on our fictional carrier. Steel bulkheads, the
 * deckhead's pipes and cable trays, a row of grey consoles with their CRTs, edge-lit plexiglass status boards, phones,
 * a clock, the general-quarters light, the operator's console close by, and the bolted chairs. The same as the browser
 * game's (assets/figure/figure.js: room, chair, roomLamps, lightRoom); both make the same triangles. Original code for
 * this project. Units: metres, y up, z away from the film's camera, x to its right. */
