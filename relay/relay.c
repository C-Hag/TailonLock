/* relay.c - matchmaking and forwarding server for online play.
 * A host registers its 6-digit game code; a guest joins with the code; from
 * then on the relay forwards each one's UDP packets to the other, so neither
 * needs to forward a port on their router. Runs on any small Linux box with
 * UDP port 27970 open:
 *
 *   tl_relay [port]
 *
 * The match itself is encrypted end to end with a key made from the code
 * (src/net.c), so the relay only sees sealed packets. The code is also that
 * key's secret, so the relay must not help anyone sweep for live codes: an
 * address gets 10 wrong codes a minute, a code 10 wrong tries a minute (from
 * anyone), and the relay as a whole 600 join tries a minute. Past a limit it
 * answers nothing, for a live code as for any other, and a wrong code and a
 * game somebody is playing get the same T_RFAIL.
 *
 * Packets start "TL", a version and a type (see src/net.c). */
