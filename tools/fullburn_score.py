"""fullburn_score.py - writes the main theme, Full Burn "Arp sound DMX10", as scores for the game's own synth
(assets/music/fullburn.json and fullburn-intro.json), so the game plays it live instead of from a recording.
Original code for this project; the MIDI file is read as the Standard MIDI File layout describes it.

    python3 tools/fullburn_score.py      # reads music/fullburn/, writes assets/music/fullburn*.json

The parts come from the song itself: every note from music/fullburn/fullburn-dmx10.mid (one track a part, on a
120 BPM grid of 2 s a bar) and the drummer's performance from music/fullburn/song/drum-hits.json (seconds in the
master). The SID tunes run on the PAL frame clock, 6 frames a 16th, so a bar is 96 / 50.1245 s and bar 1 starts
PH seconds into the master; bar 33 is the loop start A of the old recording (fullburn.loop).

The instruments are the synth's fb* patches (src/synth.c) and the drums its h2h-style kit (codes "f..."), as the
ear-safe mix (DMX10 ear) has them: the bell clock 4 dB down with a 2.9 kHz cut and a one-bar fade-in where it
enters, the buzz-arp lead dipped at 2.4 kHz. The game's own SID drums play the opening, as the SID chip did.

fullburn.json is the whole song; the game loops bars 33-72 (61.4-138.0 s, the old recording's loop), and
--render-music with TL_MUSIC_FULL=1 plays it to the end. fullburn-intro.json is the opening film's cut, as the
old fullburn-intro.wav: half a second of silence, then the song from the top for 79.1 s (bars 1-40 and the first
of 41), the last 2.5 s faded out; it plays once, and the menu's Full Burn carries on from it at the same place.
